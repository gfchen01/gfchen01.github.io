We open-source the hardware and software stack for navigation using Diablo, a wheel-legged robot. We used the [Livox-Mid360](https://www.livoxtech.com/mid-360) for SLAM, and [Diablo](https://shop.directdrive.com/products/diablo-world-s-first-direct-drive-self-balancing-wheeled-leg-robot) from Direct Drive Inc. as the chassis. Every other component of our system can be bought in Amazon. The system is able to go to a command position and avoid obstacles, which can serve as a robust platform for language or other navigation tasks. Please refer to our github repository for detailed setup instructions and usages.

abstract: Probabilistic generative model (PGM) is being widely concerned in data-driven based chemical process modeling filed for its capability in the giving the value and distribution of quality variables. However, traditional PGM based on deep learning could not extract the feature in temporal scale well, which results in the block of the application in chemical process. To solve this problem, a novel model named probabilistic generative model with long-term memory (LTM-PGM) is proposed in this work. Comparing to existing models, the LTM-PGM is capable of extracting time-variant feature and decreasing the modeling parameters simultaneously, by which the nonlinearity and dynamic of the chemical process can be modeled. Finally, the proposed model is verified in an industrial process to show its effectiveness and superiority.

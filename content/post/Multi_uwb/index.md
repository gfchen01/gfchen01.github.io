Sorry to lead you here, but this is part of our bigger work `global relative localization via convex relaxation`, which is still on-going at the moment and may be submitted, thus we cannot open source the algorithm... The picture is a kind of hardware setting while we were doing experiments. Any other technical report on the site is available, please check them out!

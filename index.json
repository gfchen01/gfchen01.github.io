Participants have to obey restrictions on robots’ themselves and rules during game play. You can find details here. The most worth noticing facts are (for software group):\nRobot design: a robot must fit inside a 0.18 meters wide and 0.15 meters high cylinder at any point in time. A dribbling device is permitted under certain restrictions. A vision pattern is a needed for robot identification. Perception: both teams share the same vision information provided by SSL, which contains the robots’ id and pose. (Extra devices are allowed, e.g., IMU) and referee instructions are sent by a software called referee box. I am a member of ZJUNlict, the 2nd best team in the history in hall of fame, and probably the best team in recent 5 years. You may find this video of the race helpful, and you can find our team description paper here, which can give you an overview of our hardware design and competition philosophy.\nIn this blog I will talk about path planning in SSL and propose a mapping \u0026amp; planning method to address the problem better. Of course, path planning is not the main challenge in the environment. But in my opinion, there are two drawbacks of current algorithm: RRT*. First, the sampling process in RRT* is inefficient in a very sparse environment in SSL matches, as there are only limited kind and number of obstacles on the field. Second, RRT* is asymptotically optimal, which is harmful to decision in some circumstances. Take a look at the figure below.\nThe former is proposed, and the latter is RRT*. The outcome of RRT* is not always the same as it samples the field, but in this occasion, which is pretty common in matches (imagine other cars are defending the **F** car), this outcome occurs frequently. But if we build the graph based on visibility, we can get an almost optimal path in a deterministic algorithm. By the way, it is also much more efficient, and we may compare the planning time of RRT* and my proposed algorithm in the above circumstance: RRT* (averaging 31 plannings) Proposed(averaging 31 plannings) 2.338 ms 0.411 ms The next part introduces the details of proposed mapping and planning algorithm.\nMapping \u0026amp; Planning Algorithm Problem Formulation Given an initial position $I$, a target position $G$, a finite map $M$. Output a path $P$ in the map $M$ so that when the robot follows $P$, it can reach the target position $G$ and avoid collision with obstacles on $M$.\nMapping details The mapping \u0026amp; planning module could receive the pose of all the robots on the field, also the state of race (e.g., ball placement, penalty, or normal state). The module plan the path of each robot separately, i.e., one robot at a time. I do not use a grid map here; keep it in mind that there are only 3 kinds of obstacles in the field, I suggest we should represent them in the minimal representation of the geometric shapes below: (obstacles are drawn in green lines below)\nCircles, for robots\nRectangles, for the penalty area (robots are not allowed in penalty except the goalie)\nLong circle, for ball placement restricted area (During ball placement state, all robots of the non-placing team have to keep at least 0.5 meters distance to the line between the ball and the placement position)\nPlanning details We can detect if a robot will collide the above geometric shapes when: a. moving on a line segment in the field; b. at a certain position. We can do this in O(1) by checking the minimal distance between the robot and the geometric shape. The planning algorithm stores points as a graph using a KD Tree.\nPlease do note that “Sample_and_addPoints” function will make changes to the graph, so the number of nodePairs also changes in the outer loop. Here is the detail of $Sample_and_addPoints$:\nThis is expressed in recursion for convenience. This algorithm will first check if the obstacle is marked (to make sure this will stop), then sample around the obstacle, and check each sampled point whether it will lead to collision with any other obstacles. If not, add the point to the graph; if it leads to collision, check each obstacle that the point collides with whether they are marked. If they aren’t marked, call the algorithm recursively on it.\nThe BuildGraph algorithm aims to achieve the following goal:\nFor any pair of nodes in the graph, either the edge between them is collision-free, or the obstacles that could cause collision are sampled.\nHere is an example. The graph is marked in green, the target is always the point at right.\nAssume F car is going to the point connected with purple line:\nThen B car got on its way. The direct path will certainly lead to collision, so add B car to obstacle and sample around it:\nE car comes and covers one of the point in the graph above. Add E car to obstacle as well.\nA car then comes and stands on one of the …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"12603afae4af5b8d90eb4f3a88fc3f4e","permalink":"https://gfchen01.github.io/post/a-novel-mapping-planning-method-for-robocup-ssl/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/a-novel-mapping-planning-method-for-robocup-ssl/","section":"post","summary":"A novel planning method based on visibility of obstacles on the field.","tags":null,"title":"A Mapping \u0026 Planning Method for RoboCup Small Size League","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Soft Sensor Using Gaussian Mixture Variational Auto-Encoder : Embed Unsupervised Category Introduction VAE is widely used in process industry for a long time. However, these works mostly focus on the nonlinear feature, and the complex dynamic processes with multi-mode characteristics are seldomly considered. Gaussian Mixture VAE(GM-VAE) can capture the multi-mode character of process, but in the GM-VAE put-forward before, an important structure is erroneous (in the view point of Bayesian Inference). I have fixed this issue using Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization and improved the model’s performance.\nThis work is advised by Prof. Ge at Zhejiang University. I deeply appreciate his help, and you can follow his work on Google Scholar (10k+ citations). link\nFor those who are familiar with VAE, please directly jump to Part IV: Unsupervised Categories and Multi-mode: GM-VAE. But I strongly recommend that you read the “why we use VAE in process industry”, to have some insight into our task.\nSoft Sensor “Soft Sensor” can be viewed as the contradiction of “Hard Sensor”. The principle of sensors are based on some physics laws, and modern sensors typically involve circuits. However, there are times when sensor cannot output critical variables at a higher frequency, or online. For example, in process engineering, process variables such as the concentration of product, are critical to controlling the whole process. However, we need to use methods such as liquid chromatography, which will take minutes to finish; or the process is long, and the inspection of a key process variable has a large delay. At the same time, some process variables (the pressure, the temperature) can be measured at a much higher frequency, and has correlation between these variables with those critical variables. This give rise to soft sensor: use data mining to approximate the process model, and infer the critical but hard to measure variables using accessible measurements.\nOne may ask: why don’t directly derive the model? For many chemical processes, we can’t, at least for now. As chemical processes are becoming more and more complicated, using first-principle is untractable in many cases. Instead of “deriving” models and check them using statistical criteria, some “universal” (by universal, I mean it can approximate a large family of functions) models that converge to a set of parameters arises – Machine Learning. This is the topic of the blog.\n**Note that in the article, we use AE and VAE to represent auto-encoder and variational auto-encoder respectively. **\nPreliminaries: Bayesian Inference, VAE, and why using them AE Variational auto-encoders are based on Bayesian Inference, and originated from auto-encoder, a generative unsupervised model. The idea of auto-encoder is quite simple:\nThe key to auto-encoder is the bottle-neck in the middle. The dimension in the middle must be smaller than that of two sides, in hope of “squeezing” the characters from datasets. The design of auto-encoder is intriguing, because it tells us something about “generative”. Auto-encoder doesn’t have good performance, and the structure that brings are much wider use of it are its variants: Stacked Auto-encoder (SAE), Variational Auto-encoder (VAE).\nVAE and Bayesian Inference VAE regards the latent variables generated by encoder as “distributions”, and then sample from them. The loss of the entire system is derived using Bayesian Inference.\nDenote the dataset as $D$, the latent variables as $\\Omega$. $D$ is generated by $\\Omega$. The key idea in Bayesian Inference is that we can estimate how close we are to the truth even if we have no knowledge about the truth. Assume there is a real distribution of the latent variables $\\Omega$, which is $p(\\Omega|D)$; and we infer a distribution of $\\Omega$ using $D$: $q(\\Omega)$ (Actually it’s $q(\\Omega|D)$, but we aren’t going to touch the conditional distribution, so we write in a compact form). Now we need to measure the “distance” between $p(\\Omega|D)$ and $q(\\Omega)$. A reasonable choice is Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL Divergence in short). $$ D_{KL}(q(\\Omega)||p(\\Omega|D)) = E_{q(\\Omega)}(log\\frac{q(\\Omega)}{p(\\Omega|D)})\\ =\\int q(\\Omega)log\\frac{q(\\Omega)p(D)}{p(D|\\Omega)p(\\Omega)}d\\Omega \\qquad (bayesian\\ rule)\\ =D_{KL}(q(\\Omega)||p(\\Omega)) - \\int q(\\Omega)log\\ p(D|\\Omega)d\\Omega + log\\ p(D) $$ The last term is a constant. Omit it. Define Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) : $$ ELBO :=-D_{KL}(q(\\Omega)||p(\\Omega)) + \\int q(\\Omega)log\\ p(D|\\Omega)d\\Omega $$ By maximizing ELBO, we can minimize the KL Divergence between $q(\\Omega)$ and $p(\\Omega|D)$. The next question is how to estimate these terms. For simplicity, assume $\\Omega$ admits a conditional gaussian distribution given $D$, then the first term can be transformed into a regularization term. You can find the detailed reasoning in appendix. As for the second term, it’s impossible to accurately calculate the integral here, but we can sample from the distribution of …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d5a720380cdf8110913b2b977fdfb8b9","permalink":"https://gfchen01.github.io/post/gmm_vae/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/gmm_vae/","section":"post","summary":"The answer is - Gumbel-Softmax!","tags":null,"title":"Improving the Sampling in Gaussian Mixture Varitional Encoder - An Important but Easy to Ignore Step","type":"post"}]
